It aims to look after their medical, emotional, social, practical, psychological, and spiritual needs, and the needs of the person's family and carers. Looking after all these aspects is often referred to as \"holistic care\".",

You can contact a hospice directly yourself, but the team will usually also ask for a referral from your doctor or nurse. Places are limited, but you can contact your local hospice to see what is available."
