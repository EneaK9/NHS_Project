                "Whether it lasts for a few seconds or a few weeks, the usual immediate effect of brain injury is a loss of consciousness. Coma can be defined as a state of depressed consciousness where a person is unresponsive to the outside world.",
                "Consciousness relies on the cerebral hemispheres interacting with an area of the brain stem called the ascending reticular activating system. Injury to these areas causes decreased consciousness or coma. You can contact theHeadway helplineto discuss any of the information provided on this page.",

Still shallower levels can occur, where the patient is able to make some response to speech. Level of coma is usually initially assessed by theGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS).",

                "Recovery from coma is a gradual process, starting with the person's eyes opening, then responding to pain, and then responding to speech. People do not just wake up from a coma, and say, 'Where am I?' as is sometimes portrayed in films. The length of coma is one of the most accuratepredictors of the severityof long-term symptoms. The longer the coma, the greater the likelihood of residual symptoms, particularly physical disabilities, although this is only a guide and some people can make good recoveries after an extended period in a coma."

                "After a coma, during a period known aspost-traumatic amnesia (PTA), the patient's behaviour may well be restless, disinhibited and agitated. Uncharacteristic behaviour such as swearing, shouting and inappropriate sexual behaviour are not unusual, but are these are best ignored, as seeing other people's distress may only increase the patient's agitation or distress. An individual cannot be held responsible for their behaviour during this period. This is a difficult time for relatives, but it is important to remember that the patient will come out of it.",
                "Length of PTA, as with length of coma, is important. This is the best indicator ofseverity of brain injury.",
                "PTA is assessed by asking the patient a number of questions at regular intervals.",
                "The first group of questions is concerned with awareness of time, place and person, for example, 'What is your name?', 'What day of the week is it?'",
                "A second group of questions relates to the patient's awareness of the accident, e.g. 'What was your last memory before the accident?' A patient deep in PTA will not be able to answer these questions correctly.",

                "If this condition persists for more than four weeks they can be classified as being in a continuing vegetative state. If it continues for 12 months after traumatic brain injury or 6 months after non-traumatic brain injury, the person can be classed as being in a permanent vegetative state. If the person shows no signs of recovery at this point and staff and family members agree then it is possible to gain a court order to withdraw treatment."

                "Vegetative states, minimally conscious states and locked-in syndrome are thankfully relatively rare. These conditions are not fully understood and accurate diagnosis can sometimes be difficult. For example, some people who have been thought to be in a vegetative state have subsequently been shown to possess some awareness. However, that does not mean that everyone does. Although most families cling to the idea that there is some awareness, lack of awareness could be preferable for a time. There is often hope of improvement in the future.",

This explains about the medical decisions that may need to be made, and the role of family and friends in the decision making process.",
