                "Each time the heart beats, the heart muscle contracts (pulls inwards) in preparation for pumping blood around the body.",
                "The contractions are triggered by electrical pulses. These are generated by a group of specialised cells known as the sinoatrial node (SA node).",
                "The SA node is often referred to as a natural pacemaker because it generates a series of electrical pulses at regular intervals.",
                "The pulse is then sent to a group of cells known as the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node relays the pulse to the 2 lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles).",
                "A pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is needed when something disrupts this process and causes an abnormal heartbeat.",

                "Most cases of sick sinus syndrome are thought to be related to age.",
