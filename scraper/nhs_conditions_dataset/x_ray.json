                "As they pass through the body, the energy from X-rays is absorbed at different rates by different parts of the body. A detector on the other side of the body picks up the X-rays after they've passed through and turns them into an image.",
                "Dense parts of your body that X-rays find it more difficult to pass through, such as bone, show up as clear white areas on the image. Softer parts that X-rays can pass through more easily, such as your heart and lungs, show up as darker areas."

                "Problems that may be detected during an X-ray include:",
                "X-rays can also be used to guide doctors or surgeons during certain procedures. For example, during acoronary angioplasty– a procedure to widen narrowed arteries near the heart – X-rays can be used to help guide a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) along one of your arteries."

                "However, you may need to stop taking certain medications and avoid eating and drinking for a few hours if you're having an X-ray that uses a contrast agent.",
                "For all X-rays, you should let the hospital know if you're pregnant. X-rays aren't usually recommended if you're pregnant unless it's an emergency.",
                "It's a good idea to wear loose comfortable clothes, as you may be able to wear these during the X-ray. Try to avoid wearing jewellery and clothes containing metal (such as zips), as these will need to be removed."

                "The X-ray will last for a fraction of a second. You won't feel anything while it's carried out.",
                "While the X-ray is being taken, you'll need to keep still so the image produced isn't blurred. More than one X-ray may be taken from different angles to provide as much information as possible.",

                "For example, barium can turn your poo a whitish colour for a few days and an injection given to relax your stomach before the X-ray may cause your eyesight to be blurry for a few hours. Some people develop a rash or feel sick after having an iodine injection.",
                "The X-ray images will often need to be examined by a doctor called a radiologist before you're told the results. They may discuss their findings with you on the same day, or they may send a report to your GP or the doctor who requested the X-ray, who can discuss the results with you a few days later."

                "Being exposed to X-rays does carry a risk of causingcancermany years or decades later, but this risk is thought to be very small.",
                "For example, an X-ray of your chest, limbs or teeth is equivalent to a few days' worth of background radiation, and has less than a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of causing cancer. For more information, seeGOV.UK: patient dose information.",
                "The benefits and risks of having an X-ray will be weighed up before it's recommended. Talk to your doctor or radiographer about the potential risks beforehand, if you have any concerns.",
