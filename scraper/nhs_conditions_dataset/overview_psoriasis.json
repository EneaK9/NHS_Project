                "These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body.",
                "Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore.",
                "Psoriasis affects around 2 in 100 people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults between 20 and 30 years old and between 50 and 60 years old. It affects men and women equally.",
                "The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a big impact on their quality of life.",
                "Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe."

                "The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.",
                "Although the process is not fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system.",
                "The immune system is your body's defence against disease and infection, but it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake in people with psoriasis.",
                "Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.",
                "Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger.",
                "Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.",
                "The condition is not contagious, so it cannot be spread from person to person."

                "If these are not effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.",
                "In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body."
